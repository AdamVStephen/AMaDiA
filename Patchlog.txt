TODO: Include Patchnotes before 0.10.2

v0.10.2: Simple Differential Equation Support
+ The Calculator now supports differential equations (only general solution)
++ (Differential Equations will get their own tab for more complex tasks like particular solution)
+ The startupmessage is now displayed before the modules load to give feedback to the user that the program is loading.
+ You can now copy the x and y values for a plot with the contextmenu in the history if the advanced mode is enabled
+ Added a Patchlog.txt

v0.10.2.1: Better Differential Parser
+ The parser now supports y'(x) with y being any function (including sin etc.), ' being ',''," or ''' and x being any single unicode letter

v0.10.2.2: Bug Fix
+ Fixed a bug where ''' and '' were not correctly parsed
+ improved handling of ODE's that do not include a "="

v0.11.0: Particular Solution
+ First Support for solving the particular solution of linear differential equations
++ (WIP: Needs Testing) (see InputExamples.txt for examples
+ You can now display the LaTeX version of the Solution of a history item via the context menu

v0.11.1: Always on Top
+ Added a checkbox to the options to try to force the Window to always stay in the foreground
++ Does not work always since this is only a request to the window manager which does not always grant this
+ When calculating an ODE the classifications are displayed in the console

v0.11.1.1: Start of Flag implementation
+ Start of Flag implementation
++ This has the effect that the output is easier to read

v0.11.1.2: Fix for Convert Button
+ Convert Button on Tab 2 works again

v0.11.1.3: Highlighting in LaTeX Input
+ The LaTeX input now highlights pairs
+ Differential equations without conditions now print their classification in the console, too.
+ Bools as the result of a function no longer raise an exception bit instead are displayed
+ "ans" is only replaced with the previous solution if it is not part of a word.
++ This means that you can Laplace transform (since the word transform was previously ripped apart...)

v0.11.1.4: Preperation for MultiDim Parser
+ First preperation for parsing things like Matrixmultipliication and Transposing matricies

v0.11.2: Better LaTeX Parser, better Derivative Input and new Test-Method
+ The LaTeX input is no longer evaluated but instead displayed as the user intended it
++ Use (expr).doit() to combine Matrices in the expression
++ Use evalf (just type it ANYWHERE) to evaluate everything
+ Added a test method that is executes many testinputs when typing "RUNTEST" in the calculator input
+ Added support for dots as derivatives
+ When a function without a variable is differentiated it is assumed x for ' and t for the dot

v0.11.2.1: Evalf for LaTeX
+ Most inputs now use the Evalf Flag to decide whether to Evaluate when converting to 

v0.12.0: Keyboard Remapper Beginning
+ AltGr+1 now types ∫ , AltGr+3 now types √ , AltGr+p now types π
+ AltGr+Shift+Number types the number as subscript

v0.12.0.1: Streamlined Keyboard Remapper
+ Merged the two Remap lists
(+ Remapper is now Toggable) (Not really)

v0.12.0.2: Bug Fix and Top Bar
+ The Remapper is now really Toggable
+ The Checkboxs for the Remapper and the Syntaxhighlighter are now in the bar where the Font Size Spinbox is to make them more accessible
+ Added Hotkeys to some options

v0.12.0.3: Remap Table Filled
+ The Remap Table is now filled with my costum layout for my Linux Laptop

v0.12.0.4: Bugfix
+ Fixed 2 Entries in the Remap Table
+ The MICRO SIGN (U+00B5) "µ" is now interpreted as GREEK SMALL LETTER MU (U+03BC) "μ" by the parser

v0.12.0.5: Bugfixes
+ Fixed ans not being replaced by last answer
+ Caused a memory leak to prevent random crashes as the memory leak is small enough to ignore it...
++ This does not make me happy and is a temporary solution but I NEED to stop the crashes... I hate QThreads...
+ Disabled option to not eval when converting to LaTeX for now due to unexpected bugs in sympy library...

v0.12.0.6: Bugfixes: Evaluate LaTeX
+ Reenabled Eval for LaTeX but gave it its own checkbox.
++ When the tick is not set a script is run independently from AMaDiA to convert to LaTeX
+++ This ensures that "with sympy.evaluate(False):" does not mess up everything (since it behaves odd when used in multithreaded Programms)

v0.12.0.7: Bugfix: Combining dot above for Windows
+ fixed the keyboardremap for the combining dots above for ATextEdit and derived Classes.
++ It is still broken in all other cases since Windows is stupid...

v0.12.0.8: Preparation for Colour Changing
+ Restructured everything about Colours and Fonts in preparation to make these things changeable during runtime

v0.12.0.9: LaTeX Eval Tristate
+ The Eval checkbox on the LaTeX tab is now tristate:
++ Do not evaluate everything
++ Evaluate some things
++ Set Evaluate=True when parsing with SymPy
+ Fixed a bug that caused a crash when plotting fails
+ The Advanced Mode now allows you to try to plot everything from all tabs

v0.12.1: Exception Notification
+ When an Error occurs the user is now notified in the main window
++ A short Description is displayed as a tooltip when hovering over the message
++ Only the most recent Error, Warning or Notification is displayed. For older Errors and warning look in the console.
++ Not all exceptions are displayed in the main window. For all exceptions and more details you still have to look in the console.

v0.12.1.1: More Notifications
+ Added more Notifications
+ Converted the Comments that described the functions and methods into strings to allow VSC to display it in the quick info
+ Fixed a crash wehen AMaS.Exists != True

v0.12.1.2: AMaS notifications
+ AMaS can now return notifications when successful (Previously only when not successful)

v0.13.0: Chat
+ Added my simple chat program
++ You can use it to send text and text files over LAN connections
++ The implementation is not final.
++ The messages are not encrypted! Do not send sensible data

v0.13.1: New Paint
+ Added the option to choose between 2 Colour Palettes: Dark and Bright
+ The Chatwindows take the colour of the main window when they were opened

v0.13.1.1: Bugfix
+ Fixed a bug that would crash everything when trying to send a message from the Chat Server

v0.13.1.2: Bugfix
+ Fixed: Notifications in Bright Mode were resetting the Backgroundcolour to the Dark Mode. Now the Bright Mode stays bright.

v0.13.1.3: Canvas Paint
+ When changing the colour all Canvas elements automatically refresh their colour

v0.13.1.4: negative power
+ The parser now supports ⁻¹,⁻²,...,⁻⁹,⁻⁰
+ The parser now supports ᵀ to transpose a matrix
+ All trailing zeroes are now removed from all numbers

v0.13.1.5: Inactive Plot Colour
+ Fixed the colour of inactive plots in bright mode

v0.13.1.6: Copy Notifications
+ Doubleclicking the notification now copies it to the clipboard.
+ If LaTeX or Control are not installed the user now gets a notification.

v0.13.1.7: UI Preparation
+ Added Tab 5 for System Control
+ Added a tab widget to tab 3 in preparation for 3D-, Complex- and nD- Plotter

v0.13.1.8: Full Screen
+ F11 toggles fullscreen
+ Added the control library to the new External_Libraries folder
+ Added "How to install" to the readme and added 2 batch files to make installation and Running/Updating easy on Windows

v0.14.0: Assuming Direct CONTROL
+ New Tab: Control Tab
++ This tab is all about System Control
++ Input transfer function or state system  to plot all associated plots
++ Doubleclick a plot to make it larger
++ Better Input and more output coming soon
+ (User Request) The LaTeX process is now started at the same time as AMaDiA to make the first display lass annoying

v0.14.0.1: 2nd Control Example
+ Added a 2nd Control Code Input Example to show a syntax for state space input

v0.14.1: Housecleaning
+ Cleaned up AMaDiA Folder by moving most code into a sub folder
++ Adjusted imports accordingly
+ Changed the Threading to use a Threadpool and worker classes
++ This Fixes the memory leak and prohibits that too many threads are active at the same time
++ The Threading mode can be changed back in the options menu
+ The Control Tab can now plot a system response for a specific input function
+ Some text files are now accessible from the UI
+ Temporarily disabled the Sympy Plotter because the control tab has broken it for unknown reasons...
++ Fixing this might take a while...
+ Streamlined folder-detection

v0.14.2: Super Plotter
+ The 2D Plot can now plot much much more reliable
++ x*exp(x) and ∫sin(x)+√(x)dx*sin'(x) are no longer a problem!
+ The SymPy Plotter will (probably) remain dead as it is not worth to fix it.
++ When the sympy plotter plots it also tries to plot all other pyplot plots
+++ This means that it makes it impossible for me to use pyplot anywhere else...
++ The sympy Plotter was never designed to be used in a GUI application anyways and the AMaDiA plotter looks better anyways.
++ Instead of trying to work around the badly implemented sympy plotter I will instead use the time to improve the AMaDiA plotter.
+ Added some comments to let VSCodes errordetection know that my code is correct and does not need to glow red and yellow...

v0.14.2.1: WIP Cleanup
+ Disabled the input tab in the control tab and removed the WIP tab in the Plot tab.
++ They should not be interactable to not confuse the user as they are currently blank
++ These were added to make future development easier as UI reworks can be a lot of work

v0.14.2.2: Welcome
+ When no message needs to be displayed on start the program now welcomes the user by username

v0.14.2.3: List Solve Fix
+ Lists are no longer processed with sympy.solve (as solving a list returns an empty list)
++ This means that "solve(a*x^2+b*x+c*1,x)" (which creates a list) no longer needs "Eval Functions" to be turned off!

v0.14.2.4: Control Input Development 1
+ UI part of the Input Tab in the Control Tab is now done.
++ Tab is still disabled since most of the functionality is not implemented yet.
+++ Changed "Reload Modules" to temporarily enable the Tab instead of reloading Modules

v0.14.2.5: Control Input Development 2
+ Fixed Error Display when System name is invalid
+ When changing the Order the columns for the Transfer Function are now added/removed from left instead of right

v0.14.2.6: Control Input Development 3
+ Renamed "Reload Modules" to "Dev Function"
+ More work on the Control input Tab
++ Added 4th input method that accepts a transfer function in most forms without the need to isolate the coefficients

v0.14.2.7: More Bode Phase Lines
+ The big version of the Bode plot has now more major y-ticks for the phase to increase readability

v0.14.3: Notification History and Better Keyboard Remapper
+ Made the alternate plotting value calculation throw an error in most cases in which it can't guarantee a correct plot
+ The Notification tooltip is now instantaneous and clicking on it opens the Notification History
++ The Notification History is updated for new notifications automatically
+ The Keyboard Remapper handles AltGr better and seems to win the fight against evil Windows most of the time
+ First implementation of superscript (^1 now prints ¹ when you are quick)
+ Improved the layout of the Dark Theme class in AMaDiA_Colour.py

v0.14.3.1: Synchronous Appearance
+ The Colour of all open sub-windows now changes when the colour of the main window is changed
+ The font size of all open sub-windows (except chat server and client) now changes when the font size of the main window is changed

v0.14.3.2: Error Button
+ After questioning some testers it seems that the Error label was not intuitive thus it is now a button
++ To make it even more intuitive the button now as a corresponding icon

v0.14.4: QoL
+ Tables no longer loop to the start/end but instead go to the next widget with tabulator
+ Textfields now use tabulator to select the next widget
+ Fixed multiline syntaxhighlighting for textfields
+ Control/Input/Transfer: return now selects next relevant field
+ Control/Input: The save buttons are now part of the upper splitter (as this makes immensely more sense)
+ Identified two colours (Light and Dark) and fixed the colour of the lines in Plotter/2D/Config
