TODO: Include Patchnotes before 0.10.2

v0.10.2: Simple Differential Equation Support
+ The Calculator now supports differential equations (only general solution)(Differential Equations will get their own tab for more complex tasks like particular solution)
+ The startupmessage is now displayed before the modules load to give a feedback to the user that the program is loading.
+ You can now copy the x and y values for a plot with the contextmenu in the history if the advanced mode is enabled
+ Added a Patchlog.txt

v0.10.2.1: Better Differential Parser
+ The parser now supports y'(x) with y being any function (including sin etc.), ' being ',''," or ''' and x being any single unicode letter

v0.10.2.2: Bug Fix
+ Fixed a bug where ''' and '' were not correctly parsed
+ improved handling of ODE's that do not include a "="

v0.11.0: Particular Solution
+ First Support for solving the particular solution of linear differential equations (WIP: Needs Testing) (see InputExamples.txt for examples
+ You can now display the LaTeX version of the Solution of a history item via the context menu

v0.11.1: Always on Top
+ Added a checkbox to the options to try to force the Window to always stay in the foreground
++ Does not work always since this is only a request to the window manager which does not always grant this
+ When calculating an ODE the classifications are displayed in the console

v0.11.1.1: Start of Flag implementation
+ Start of Flag implementation
++ This has the effect that the output is easier to read

v0.11.1.2: Fix for Convert Button
+ Convert Button on Tab 2 works again

v0.11.1.3: Highlighting in LaTeX Input
+ The LaTeX input now highlights pairs
+ Differential equations without conditions now print their classification in the console, too.
+ Bools as the result of a function no longer raise an exception bit instead are displayed
+ "ans" is only replaced with the previous solution if it is not part of a word.
++ This means that you can Laplace transform (since the word transform was previously ripped apart...)

v0.11.1.4: Preperation for MultiDim Parser
+ First preperation for parsing things like Matrixmultipliication and Transposing matricies

v0.11.2: Better LaTeX Parser, better Derivative Input and new Test-Method
+ The LaTeX input is no longer evaluated but instead displayed as the user intended it
++ Use (expr).doit() to combine Matrices in the expression
++ Use evalf (just type it ANYWHERE) to evaluate everything
+ Added a test method that is executes many testinputs when typing "RUNTEST" in the calculator input
+ Added support for dots as derivatives
+ When a function without a variable is differentiated it is assumed x for ' and t for the dot

v0.11.2.1: Evalf for LaTeX
+ Most inputs now use the Evalf Flag to decide whether to Evaluate when converting to 

v0.12.0: Keyboard Remapper Beginning
+ AltGr+1 now types ∫ , AltGr+3 now types √ , AltGr+p now types π
+ AltGr+Shift+Number types the number as subscript

v0.12.0.1: Streamlined Keyboard Remapper
+ Merged the two Remap lists
(+ Remapper is now Toggable) (Not really)

v0.12.0.2: Bug Fix and Top Bar
+ The Remapper is now really Toggable
+ The Checkboxs for the Remapper and the Syntaxhighlighter are now in the bar where the Font Size Spinbox is to make them more accessible
+ Added Hotkeys to some options

v0.12.0.3: Remap Table Filled
+ The Remap Table is now filled with my costum layout for my Linux Laptop

v0.12.0.4: Bugfix
+ Fixed 2 Entries in the Remap Table
+ The MICRO SIGN (U+00B5) "µ" is now interpreted as GREEK SMALL LETTER MU (U+03BC) "μ" by the parser

v0.12.0.5: Bugfixes
+ Fixed ans not being replaced by last answer
+ Caused a memory leak to prevent random crashes as the memory leak is small enough to ignore it... which does not make me happy and is a temporary solution but I NEED to stop the crashes... I hate QThreads...
+ Disabled option to not eval when converting to LaTeX for now due to unexpected bugs in sympy library...

v0.12.0.6: Bugfixes: Evaluate LaTeX
+ Reenabled Eval for LaTeX but gave it its own checkbox.
++ When the tick is not set a script is run independently from AMaDiA to convert to LaTeX to ensure that "with sympy.evaluate(False):" does not mess up everything (since it behaves odd when used in multithreaded Programms)

v0.12.0.7: Bugfix: Combining dot above for Windows
+ fixed the keyboardremap for the combining dots above for ATextEdit and derived Classes. It is still broken in all other cases since Windows is stupid...

v0.12.0.8: Preparation for Colour Changing
+ Restructured everything about Colours and Fonts in preparation to make these things changeable during runtime

v0.12.0.9: LaTeX Eval Tristate
+ The Eval checkbox on the LaTeX tab is now tristate:
++ Do not evaluate everything
++ Evaluate some things
++ Set Evaluate=True when parsing with SymPy
+ Fixed a bug that caused a crash when plotting fails
+ The Advanced Mode now allows you to try to plot everything from all tabs

v0.12.1: Exception Notification
+ When an Error occurs the user is now notified in the main window and gets a short description as a tooltip when hovering over the message
++ Only the most recent Error, Warning or Notification is displayed. For older Errors and warning look in the console.
++ Not all exceptions are displayed in the main window. For all exceptions and more details you still have to look in the console.

v0.12.1.1: More Notifications
+ Added more Notifications
+ Converted the Comments that described the functions and methods into strings to allow VSC to display it in the quick info
+ Fixed a crash wehen AMaS.Exists != True

v0.12.1.2: AMaS notifications
+ AMaS can now return notifications when successful (Previously only when not successful)

v0.13.0: Chat
+ Added my simple chat program
++ You can use it to send text and text files over LAN connections
++ The implementation is not final.
++ The messages are not encrypted! Do not send sensible data
