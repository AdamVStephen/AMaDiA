TODO: Include Patchnotes before 0.10.2

v0.10.2: Simple Differential Equation Support
+ The Calculator now supports differential equations (only general solution)(Differential Equations will get their own tab for more complex tasks like particular solution)
+ The startupmessage is now displayed before the modules load to give a feedback to the user that the program is loading.
+ You can now copy the x and y values for a plot with the contextmenu in the history if the advanced mode is enabled
+ Added a Patchlog.txt

v0.10.2.1: Better Differential Parser
+ The parser now supports y'(x) with y being any function (including sin etc.), ' being ',''," or ''' and x being any single unicode letter

v0.10.2.2: Bug Fix
+ Fixed a bug where ''' and '' were not correctly parsed
+ improved handling of ODE's that do not include a "="

v0.11.0: Particular Solution
+ First Support for solving the particular solution of linear differential equations (WIP: Needs Testing) (see InputExamples.txt for examples
+ You can now display the LaTeX version of the Solution of a history item via the context menu

v0.11.1: Always on Top
+ Added a checkbox to the options to try to force the Window to always stay in the foreground
++ Does not work always since this is only a request to the window manager which does not always grant this
+ When calculating an ODE the classifications are displayed in the console

v0.11.1.1: Start of Flag implementation
+ Start of Flag implementation
++ This has the effect that the output is easier to read

v0.11.1.2: Fix for Convert Button
+ Convert Button on Tab 2 works again
