TODO: Include Patchnotes before 0.10.2

v0.10.2: Simple Differential Equation Support
+ The Calculator now supports differential equations (only general solution)(Differential Equations will get their own tab for more complex tasks like particular solution)
+ The startupmessage is now displayed before the modules load to give a feedback to the user that the program is loading.
+ You can now copy the x and y values for a plot with the contextmenu in the history if the advanced mode is enabled
+ Added a Patchlog.txt

v0.10.2.1: Better Differential Parser
+ The parser now supports y'(x) with y being any function (including sin etc.), ' being ',''," or ''' and x being any single unicode letter

v0.10.2.2: Bug Fix
+ Fixed a bug where ''' and '' were not correctly parsed
+ improved handling of ODE's that do not include a "="
