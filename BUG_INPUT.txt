Plot:
	x*exp(x)
		Works in the SymPy Plotter
		Does not work in the integrated plotter as lambdify seems to be broken???
			The Array is structured like this:
				each field is x*exp(Array) with x being the value for x and Array being the Array of all values for x
					It is an array of arrays...
		exp(x*ln(x)) works
		exp(x+ln(x)) ( = x*exp(x) ) does not work...
